squRemote
===
This is the PC part of the squRemote app (for Linux).
Android app: http://squgeim.blogspot.com/2013/12/squremote.html

Usage
---

You can run squRemote.py with root. This will run a Tkinter GUI with the current ip address and port no. Running squRemote.sh will do the same with gksu.

OR

You can run squR.py from the console with root. This doesnot require Tkinter or gksu.

Dependencies
---
1. evdev (http://python-evdev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
2. tk (https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)
3. gksu (http://www.nongnu.org/gksu)

*2 and 3 are optional (read usage)

Note
---
This was a small one time project for me, so I can't promise any bug fixes or updates (I know a couple of bugs).
